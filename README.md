# My Ninth Coding Challenge
Hello again, everyone! This is my ninth coding project using JavaScript. Here, I will practice my JavaScript class-based object-oriented programming (OOP) skills by working with class structures, inheritance, and methods in business-related scenarios. 
My project is split into 5 Tasks: 
+ Task 1: Creating an Employee Class
+ Task 2: Creating a Manager Class (Inheritance & Method Overriding) 
+ Task 3: Creating a Company Class
+ Task 4: Implementing a Payroll System
+ Task 5: Implementing Promotions

I hope that you enjoy my attempt on the challenge!
